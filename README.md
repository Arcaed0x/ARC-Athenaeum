# ARC-Athenaeum
A library filled with elegant tools topped with an elegant name.

In this library I try to make functional features such as filter and map available for modern C++ programmers to use.
This is a very interesting project and I hope to further it on.

Current the libray is header only and has its own namespace name ARC. To use the functionality you must first include the following headers and namespaces like so:

#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

using namespace ARC;

NOTE : You must be using the C++11 compiler flag [This may be subject to change soon]
