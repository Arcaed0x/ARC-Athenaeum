# ARC-Athenaeum
A library filled with elegant functional tools topped with an elegant name.

In this library I try to make functional features such as filter and map available for modern C++ programmers to use with the std::vector type.
This is a very interesting project and I hope to further it on.

Current the library is header only and has its own namespace name ARC. To use the functionality include the following header and namespace like so:

```c++
  #include "ARC.hpp"

  using namespace ARC;
```

or

```c++
  #include "ARC.hpp"

  //ARC:: prefix before each type
```

NOTE : You must be using the C++11 compiler flag [This may be subject to change soon]
